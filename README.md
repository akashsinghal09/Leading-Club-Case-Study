## General Information
- The objective of this case study is to understand Lending Club loan data, use our skills learnt on EDA, apply them to produce a business usable output
- We use our understanding to cleanse the given data, eliminate data that does not provide us any insight. Understanding on risk underwriting methodologies for loan acquisition. Use Univariate and Bivariate analysis through different charts to plot and compare the data. Derive a conclusion based on the analysis
- The dataset used for the project is loan.csv provided by upGrad


## Conclusions
- Grade B5 is the riskiest of all customers and likely to be charged off
- Count of customers with home ownership ‘Rent’ is the highest
- Employees with longer emp_length got the loan approved for a higher amount.
- For grade G and interest rate above 20% -Verified loan applications tend to have higher loan amount. Which indicates that the firms are first verifying the loans with higher values
- The interest rate for charged off loans is higher than that of fully paid loans in all the loan_amount groups. this can be a driving factor for loan defaulting.
- Applicants applying for long term has applied for more loan
